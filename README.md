# collecting-data-resit
According to email Federico sent me on 12th Feb, I have to resubmit A3,A4, and A5.1
so it contains three assignments: A3;A4;A5.1
*In 3.1, I scraped the lyrics of five of Rihanna's songs and formed a table.
*In 4, I made five visualisations, but one of the bar chart did not show a picture in the submitted assignment, just like I did in the final individual assignment.
*As for 5.1, I chose a data about movies and made a visualisation of the data in it. The data is attached.
